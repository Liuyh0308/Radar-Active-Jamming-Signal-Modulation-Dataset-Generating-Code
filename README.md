（1）This is a simulation dataset generation code for radar active jamming signals written by the author himself, please open this code in Matlab and then run it directly.

（2）This code can generate and save three kinds of eigenmode data of 11 kinds of active jamming signals in time domain, frequency domain and time-frequency domain, which have 1D sequence mode and 2D image mode.

（3）Users can adjust various signal parameters in the code file, or add multipath fading or Doppler shift to simulate different scenarios.

（4）This code can be used in the field of radar interference detection, identification or denoising.
